Rock Paper Scissors - Console Game
📋 Project Description

This is a simple C++ console application for the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The user plays against the computer, and the game continues in rounds until the user chooses to exit.
🧠 Learning Goals and OOP Concepts Applied

This project was created by me as part of my learning journey through the ProgrammingAdvices platform.
I developed it to reflect my understanding of OOP principles and proper code organization.
✅ Key Concepts Used:

    Encapsulation: Each responsibility is separated into its own class (Game, Player, Computer, etc.).

    Abstraction: The game logic and UI are separated from internal details.

    Polymorphism (Optional Extension): The system can be extended to use abstract base classes for different player types.

    Maintainability & Reusability: Clean modular structure allowing easy modifications and enhancements.

🖥️ Features

    Playable through the terminal.

    Tracks and displays score across rounds.

    Validates input from the user.

    Uses random number generation for the computer’s choice.

    Displays the winner of each round and overall score.

🚀 How to Run

    Compile using a C++ compiler:

    g++ -o rps main.cpp
    ./rps

    Follow the prompts to play.

👨‍💻 Author

I am the sole developer of this project, this project idea suggested by programmingAdvices in course: 05 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 2
I created this to apply what I learned from ProgrammingAdvices and to demonstrate my skills in writing clean, well-structured C++ applications.
